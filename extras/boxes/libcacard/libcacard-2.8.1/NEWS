  spice-gtk)

v2.6.0
======

- provides implementation of GSC-IS 2.1 (aka CAC version 2) to improve
  interoperability with guest software using the emulated or shared
  smart cards. The previously implemented CACv1 specification is no
  longer supported by any other application so the old code is gone
  and any application depending on this old standard will not work
  anymore.

  solution

- fix mingw cross-compilation
- add error checking to vcard_emul_options()
- add VCARD_DIRECT implementation to provide direct communication with
